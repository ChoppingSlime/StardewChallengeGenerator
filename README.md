# üéØ Purpose

This tool aims to enhance long-term Stardew Valley playthroughs by introducing a dynamic challenge system. It incorporates seasonal and yearly quests, a scoring mechanism, stacking penalties (maluses), and rewards for successful completion. The primary goals are to increase replayability, encourage strategic planning, and foster a light competitive or cooperative framework for both solo and multiplayer experiences.

# üß© Core Systems Overview

## Quests

The Stardew Valley Challenge Tool features two types of quests: Seasonal Quests and Yearly Quests.

Both quest types share these core elements:

* Categories: Define the type of quest (e.g., Growing, Fishing, Mining).
* Tags: Metadata used internally to filter the pool of specific quests within a category based on game settings.
* Conflicting Maluses: A list of maluses that would make a specific quest impossible to complete.

Differences between Seasonal and Yearly Quests:

* Seasonal Quests are activated at the beginning of each season, while Yearly Quests are activated at the beginning of Spring each year.
* Seasonal Quests are additionally filtered by the quest's assigned seasons (e.g., Spring, Summer, All-Year).
* Completing a Seasonal Quest adds 1 point to the Score counter
* Failing a Yearly Quest removes 4 points from the score counter.

## Maluses

Maluses are negative conditions or penalties applied to the player's playthrough.

* Maluses are applied when the player fails a Seasonal Quest.
* Upon user interaction ("the roll"), one malus is randomly selected from the wheel.
* Tags: Metadata used internally to filter maluses based on game settings (singleplayer only, co-op only).

## Rewards

Rewards are item codes that the player is permitted to obtain In-Game through the Item code exploit one time per reward.

* Spinning a reward wheel will give the player 3 different item codes
* Tags

# üåÄ Wheels

## Seasonal Quest Wheel (SQW)

* Activated at the beginning of each season.
* Displays only the different seasonal quest categories
* Upon user interaction, one of these categories is randomly selected from the wheel.
* Off-screen, after a category is selected, the app randomly picks one specific quest from the pool of challenges belonging to that chosen category by filtering out unavailable quests checking ‚Äúseason‚Äù and ‚Äútags‚Äù
* Upon a quest is chosen, the player is asked to confirm the quest or reroll it.
* Rerolling the quest will just make the wheel roll again.

* After selecting a quest, it will be added to the ‚Äúcurrent seasonal quest‚Äù tab.

## Yearly Quest Wheel (YQW)

* Activated at the start of Spring each year.
* Displays only the different yearly quest categories
* Upon user interaction, one of these categories is randomly selected from the wheel.
* Off-screen, after a category is selected, the app randomly picks one specific quest from the pool of challenges belonging to that chosen category by filtering out unavailable quests checking ‚Äútags‚Äù
* Upon a quest is chosen, the player is asked to confirm the quest or reroll it.
* Rerolling the quest will just make the wheel roll again.
* Confirming the quest will select it
* After selecting a quest, it will be added to the ‚Äúcurrent yearly quest‚Äù tab.

## Malus Wheel (MW)

* Activated upon failing a Seasonal Quest.

* Upon user interaction, one malus is randomly selected from the wheel and added to the ‚ÄúActive Maluses‚Äù tab.

# üîÑ Game Flow Logic

## At Game Start:

* User selects "Create New Challenge Generator."
* User sets the challenge generator name.
* User sets the starting year and season.
* Since there is no active Yearly quest, a YQW rolls, and a category is selected.
* The app automatically picks a random specific Seasonal Quest from the chosen category, filtered by the tags.
* Player is asked to confirm or reroll the yearly quest
* If reroll the process repeats from the start
* If confirm, the quest is added to the ‚Äúcurrent yearly quest‚Äù tab
* Since there is no active Seasonal quest, a SQW rolls, and a category is selected.
* The app automatically picks a random specific Seasonal Quest from the chosen category, filtered by the tags and current season.
* Player is asked to confirm or reroll the seasonal quest
* If reroll the process repeats from the start
* If confirm, the quest is added to the ‚Äúcurrent seasonal quest‚Äù tab

## On "Proceed to Next Season" button:

* In the background, the game advances by one season (if it's Winter, it goes to Spring and adds 1 year).
* A 3-tab panel opens:
    * Tab 1: Confirmation
        * Asks if the player has completed or not the Yearly challenge (only if the current season is Spring, meaning a new year has begun).
        * Asks if the player has completed or not the Seasonal challenge.
        * "Confirm" button.
    * Tab 2: Results
        * After selecting the options and clicking "Confirm," this tab displays the outcome:
            * Winning a Yearly Quest: Reward Wheel opens.
            * Losing a Yearly Quest: Panel displays "-4 points."
            * Winning a Seasonal Quest: Panel displays "+1 point" and clears all active maluses.
            * Losing a Seasonal Quest: Malus Wheel opens.
        * Wheel panels won't start spinning until a button is clicked.
        * "Continue" button (clickable only after all existing wheels have been used). Clicking it moves the player to Tab 3.
    * Tab 3: New Quests
        * Displays the Seasonal Quest Wheel (and Yearly Quest Wheel if it's Spring).
        * Rolling each wheel selects the new Seasonal/Yearly quests and removes the previous one.
